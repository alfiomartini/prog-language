# A (Programming) Language based on Application Expressions

This is a parser/evaluator for a simple imperative programming language, whose constructs are uniformly expressed as (function) applications. The language also supports some abstraction by the definition of (recursive) functions. Line comments and (one-dimensional) arrays are also provided. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Marijn Haverbeke (Eloquent Javascript) and it is developed entirely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
