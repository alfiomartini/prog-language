# A (Programming) Language based on Application Expressions

This is a parser/evaluator for a simple imperative programming language, whose constructs are uniformly expressed as applications expressions. The scope chain that links global and local environments is modeled with the object prototype chains provided by JavaScript. The interpreter is comprised by a parser and a evaluator. The first is a top down recursive descent parser written by hand from a context free grammar of the language. The regular subset of the language is recognized with _regular expressions_. The evaluator is defined by a recursive function that follows the inductive definition of application expressions (see above). The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Marijn Haverbeke (Eloquent Javascript) and it is developed entirely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
